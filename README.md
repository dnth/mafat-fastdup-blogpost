# Data Insights from the MAFAT Satellite Vision Challenge

[![mafat](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6821286/223626468-30bc770e-c749-48af-8a60-e4a8debc8270.png)](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/9603)


In this repository, I use a free tool known as [`fastdup`](https://github.com/visual-layer/fastdup) to gain data insights from [MAFAT Satellite Vision Challenge](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/9603) labeled and unlabeled data.

`fastdup` is a free tool used to manage, clean & curate visual data.
It is fast (runs on you CPU) and scalable. It can handle up to 400M images on a single CPU machine.

The main features of `fastdup` include -
+ Finding duplicates.
+ Finding anomalies.
+ Clustering similar images.

In this repository I ran `fastdup` on both the labeled and unlabeled data, and document my findings.

At a high level `fastdup` find the following potential issues in the labeled dataset (1457 images) -

+ A total of 12 fully identical images (`d>0.990`), which are `0.27 %`.
+ A total of 25 nearly identical images (`d>0.980`), which are `0.57 %`.
+ A total of 559 above threshold images (`d>0.900`), which are `12.79 %`.
+ A total of 145 outlier images (`d<0.050`), which are `3.32 %`.


At a high level `fastdup` find the following potential issues in the unlabeled dataset (8258 images) -

+ A total of 914 fully identical images (`d>0.990`), which are `3.69 %`.
+ A total of 466 nearly identical images (`d>0.980`), which are `1.88 %`.
+ A total of 7393 above threshold images (`d>0.900`), which are `29.84 %`.
+ A total of 825 outlier images (`d<0.050`), which are `3.33 %`.

## üí≠ So what?
As you can see not all images are useful in training a model.

+ Duplicate images do no provide additional insights. They hog disk space and prolong your training time. These can be discarded.
+ Overly dark/bright/blur images without any objects also do not provide value.
+ For the clusters and outliers, I'll leave it for you to decide if they are useful to train a model.

Curating a dataset goes a long way in making sure a model works.

In my opinion these are low-hanging fruits that can be addressed to ensure the dataset is reasonably "clean" before training any model.

If you're interested to explore the dataset yourself, read on.

Happy hacking.


## üìÇ Folder Structure

+ `dataset/` - Stores the image dataset downloaded from the MAFAT official webpage. [Sign up](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/9603) and downloaded the data into this folder.

+ `fastdup_report/` - Stores the reports from fastdup.

+ `fastdup_train.ipynb` - [Notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/dnth/mafat-fastdup-blogpost/blob/main/fastdup_train.ipynb) to analyze the labeled training images.

+ `fastdup_unlabeled.ipynb` - [Notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/dnth/mafat-fastdup-blogpost/blob/main/fastdup_unlabeled.ipynb) to analyze the unlabeled images.

## üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Duplicates
`fastdup` is extremely fast and robust at finding duplicate images. 

In the unlabeled dataset, I find 927 fully identical images which is 3.74 % of the unlabeled data.
See the notebook [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/dnth/mafat-fastdup-blogpost/blob/main/fastdup_unlabeled.ipynb).

## üß© Components
I also used `fastdup` to find similar looking images (clusters).

As shown below, there are many similar looking images clustered together.
These clusters may or may not provide insights.

## üé∏ Outliers
`fastdup` can also be used to find anomalies in the dataset. The following gallery shows images that are "different" (measured using `cosine` distance) compared to the rest in the unlabeled dataset.
